                target="_blank">Regular physical activity</a> improves heart function and the condition of blood vessels.
            People who exercise consistently have a lower risk of developing cardiovascular diseases,
            including coronary heart disease and stroke. Physical activity improves endothelial function,
            lowers blood pressure, and improves blood lipid profiles.

        </h2>
        <p>
            Regular physical activity strengthens the musculoskeletal system. Strength training increases muscle mass
            and joint stability, which helps prevent injuries and improves balance. Stretching and flexibility exercises
            increase joint mobility, reduce stiffness, and help maintain activity even in older age.

            Physical activity stimulates bone tissue formation and maintains bone density. This is especially important
            for preventing osteoporosis and reducing the risk of fractures in older adults. In addition, moderate
            exercise reduces chronic joint pain, helps slow the progression of osteoarthritis, and supports limb
            functionality.

            Regular training improves coordination and balance, which reduces the risk of falls and injuries. Overall,
            physical activity helps maintain independence and mobility throughout life, making a person more active and
            energetic.

                class="text-decoration-none">Brain and Cognitive Functions</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Physical activity has a strong positive effect on the brain. Exercise improves blood flow to the brain and
            supplies it with oxygen and nutrients, supporting neuronal activity. Regular training promotes the growth
            of neurotrophic factors that support neuron health and stimulate neuroplasticity — the brain’s ability to
            adapt and form new connections.

            Sports improve memory, attention, and learning ability. People who engage in regular physical activity have
            a lower risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia with age. In addition, exercise has a positive
            effect on emotional well-being, reduces anxiety, improves mood, and promotes the release of endorphins,
            helping to combat stress and depression.

            Cardio activities such as running, swimming, and walking, as well as strength training, have a комплексное
            effect on the brain, improving both cognitive function and psycho-emotional health. Even moderate daily
            activity helps maintain mental clarity and brain activity with age.

                class="text-decoration-none">Longevity</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Physical activity is directly linked to increased life expectancy and improved quality of life. People who
            exercise regularly have a lower risk of premature death from cardiovascular and chronic diseases such as
            diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and certain types of cancer. Even moderate exercise helps slow
            age-related changes in the body, maintain muscle mass, strengthen bones and joints, preserve cognitive
            function, and support emotional health. Regular activity promotes better sleep, increases energy levels, and
            improves overall endurance. Physical activity also improves metabolism and helps maintain a healthy weight,
            reducing the risk of obesity and related diseases. Overall, sports allow a person to remain active,
            energetic, and independent for longer, improve quality of life, and contribute to a long and healthy old
            age.
