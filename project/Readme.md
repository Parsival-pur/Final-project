#### Description:
My project, called SportSite, is a web application designed to help users understand the risks of a sedentary lifestyle and the importance of proper nutrition. I have been actively involved in sports and have been studying research on this topic for several years, which helped me realize the scale of the problem: obesity caused by poor eating habits is linked to hundreds of health issues. This was the main motivation for creating a project at the intersection of programming and health. For the back-end, I used Python and Flask with an SQLite database, and for the front-end, I used HTML and Bootstrap.

Switching from CS50’s cloud environment to VS Code was a challenge for me. I had to figure out Python setup, virtual environments, and dependency management. I chose to focus on Python because I felt more confident in it after the course than in JavaScript, which allowed me to build a more reliable application architecture where all requests are handled on the server side.

The first big task was implementing registration and login. At first, the app would crash when restarted due to database conflicts, but I fixed it using the CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS command. I also learned to comment each function and variable in detail to avoid confusion in the logic, although in the final version I kept only the essential notes. I deliberately chose not to store users’ calculation history in the database to simplify the project and focus on making the algorithms work correctly. Each part of the app has its own page: registration, login, profile, and calculators.

In the BMI calculator, I faced the common issue of users entering height in centimeters. I added warnings and server-side validation to prevent absurd results like a BMI of zero, and I also checked for negative values. I included a note that BMI may not be accurate for people with high muscle mass.

The users.db database is structured with a table users where id is INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT and username is UNIQUE, which allowed me to handle registration errors on the SQL level. Security is handled via Flask sessions. Currently, passwords are stored in plain text, but I already plan to add password hashing using werkzeug.security in the future. All HTML templates are in the templates folder, and routing logic is in app.py. I used Jinja2 templates to separate navigation and footer into individual files.

I also implemented a calorie calculator using the Mifflin–St Jeor formula, which considers gender, age, height, and weight. While debugging, I encountered errors like OperationalError due to database locks, which I solved myself using chatbots only for guidance. I also translated the site into English to make it accessible internationally. Bootstrap helped make the design responsive, and I verified health information through CDC and WHO. To keep the repository lightweight, I used direct image links.

Future improvements for SportSite could include saving users’ previous BMI and calorie calculations in the database, which would allow displaying personal progress over time. I could also add graphs and charts for better visual feedback, implement a more advanced user authentication system with hashed passwords and optional two-factor authentication, and expand the calculators to include additional fitness and nutrition metrics, like macronutrient distribution or workout tracking. Another improvement would be to allow users to customize goals and receive recommendations based on their lifestyle. These enhancements would make the app more interactive and closer to a full-featured health platform.

This project taught me not only how to code but also how to create a useful and safe product that solves real problems for users in health and fitness.
